Abstract— Nowadays, technology is everywhere, and it’s constantly providing us with ways to work more efficiently and save time. One such program or tool is the Smart Interviewing System, which automates the conventional interviewing process utilizing contemporary NLP methods and deep learning technologies. Interviewers and HR management staff employed by various organizations who conduct technology-related interviews will primarily benefit from the solution. The system works by figuring patterns from human audio and writing. It converts human voice into computer-understandable inputs which are used in our AI Interviewer. AI-based Interviewer is unable to identify cheating and the questions are only asked from the dataset on which the model is trained.
